# Bundled Viewer catalogs

`manifest.json` enrolls the catalogs that `meta.locale` selects automatically.
The renderer reads only the files listed there, relative to this installed
directory. It never scans this directory, the working directory, or anywhere
else for language files.

`en.json` is the canonical message set and the final fallback. Every other
catalog is validated against it per key: a missing, unknown, or
placeholder-mismatched entry falls back to English and is reported when that
locale is rendered. A new UI key may therefore ship in English first.

Each message resolves as: valid `meta.translations` value → selected bundled
catalog → English. See [the authoring contract](../references/authoring-contract.md).

To enroll a language, add its complete catalog here and one manifest entry.
No renderer or schema change is needed. Locale tags match case-insensitively;
region and script variants (for example `zh-Hant`) are distinct tags and are
never collapsed onto another catalog.

| Locale | Origin | Review status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `en` | Archify source strings | Canonical |
| `zh-CN` | #108 | Maintained with the renderer |
| `es` | Juan Pablo Tamayo (#457, moved to data in #586) | Complete; not independently native-reviewed |
| `ko` | uygnoey (#457) | Complete; not independently native-reviewed |

Completeness checks prove key and placeholder coverage, not native wording,
plural grammar, right-to-left layout, or glyph coverage.

Other reusable, unenrolled examples live in `../examples/locales/`; supply
them through `meta.translations`.
